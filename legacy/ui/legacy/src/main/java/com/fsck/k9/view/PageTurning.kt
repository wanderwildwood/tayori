/**
 * A swipe moves the list one screen, and then stops.
 *
 * The same page turn as Messaging's, which is where it was worked out: MMD's own lists step
 * rather than scroll, because a panel that redraws in full renders inertia as a smear. These
 * lists are RecyclerViews with swipe actions hung off them, so they take the behaviour rather
 * than MMD's component.
 *
 * **The last line of the old page becomes the first line of the new one.** Whichever row the
 * page landed part-way through is pulled fully into view, so a page always opens on a row's
 * edge with one row of overlap to read on from.
 *
 * Only plainly vertical gestures are claimed, so a sideways swipe still reaches the swipe
 * actions underneath. Once a page has turned the rest of the drag is swallowed: one swipe is
 * one page, however far the finger keeps travelling.

 * bottom is the one row this page exists to show: the row just above the page before. Paging
 * up through a thread skipped a message every page or two, and they were there again on the
 * way down (forum: "some messages get lost in the scroll").

 * lands whole at the bottom of this one, the line to read back from. The top row is pulled
 * into view only when that costs no more than the overlap row itself -- something already
